# Smart City Transport Mode Choice Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project develops predictive models for urban transport mode choice using large-scale smart city trip data. The work was completed during my internship at SenseTimeâ€™s Smart Cities & Business Group, leveraging both classical econometric models and modern neural networks to improve forecasting accuracy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Model travel mode choice behavior for over 200 million trip records.
- Compare multinomial logit regression with neural network approaches.
- Optimize model parameters to enhance predictive performance.
- Support smart city transport planning with robust analytical tools.

## ðŸ“Š Methods & Tools
- **Multinomial Logit Regression (MNL)** â€“ mode choice probability estimation.
- **Neural Networks** â€“ multi-layer architecture trained on synthetic utility data with controlled noise.
- **Parameter Optimization** â€“ grid search on sensitivity and noise parameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics** â€“ KL divergence, Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras.
